# Angry Birds-Style 3D Game

This is a 3D projectile-based game inspired by *Angry Birds*, where the player shoots moving targets using a cannon.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- The player uses a **cannon** to shoot at **mobile targets** (represented as houses).
- There are **two types of ammunition**:
  - **Spike Ball** – Deals **25 damage**
  - **Bomb** – Deals **50 damage**
- The player starts with **5 units of each ammo type**.
- Pressing **TAB** switches between the two ammo types.
  - The default ammo is the **Spike Ball**.

## 🏠 Targets

- Each target (house) has **100 HP (health points)**.
- Once a target's health reaches zero, it is deactivated.
- When all targets are destroyed, the player wins.

## ⚙️ Customization

- All gameplay values (ammo count, damage, health, etc.) are configurable via the Unity **Inspector**.
- Targets can optionally move in non-linear paths (e.g., sine waves).

## ✅ Features

- **Object Pooling** for efficient projectile management
- **DOTween**-based movement for projectiles and targets
- **Event-driven architecture** with a global `GameEventDispatcher`
- **Victory/Defeat UI** with restart button
- No use of `Update()` in core gameplay logic — fully event-based!
